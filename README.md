# T-Rex-chrome-game-bot

This project uses Pyautogui, Pillow, and OpenCV to automate the google chrome dinosaur game:

-Pyautogui makes the dinosaur jump

-Pillow makes a screenshot of the area in front of the dinosaur and turns that picture into greyscale matrixes which are analyzed to determine if there is an obstacle in front of the dino

-OpenCv makes us able to see the images which are being analyzed by Pillow
